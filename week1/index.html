        <h1>Localstorage</h1>
        <p>Javascript</p>
        <p>
            When you want to get the user’s input from any input or text area tag, you use the special word ‘value.’ When you want to show something to a user, you use a section and the special word ‘innerHTML.’ So...if your dealing with an input or textarea use value; a section, use innerHTML. Don’t get these mixed up. If you do, your code will run without an error but your page won’t get or display anything. Be careful. You’ll just have to remember which word to use in these two different situations, input or textarea use value and section uses innerHTML. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Now for the new bit. Using JavaScript you can store any information you want to use later. Even if your user refreshes the page or goes to some other site and then comes back, anything you’ve saved will still be there. Handy! I’m pretty sure the user wants to save their story so they can edit it or add to it even if they have left the page. Line 14 is the code that stores the story. It uses something called ‘localStorage.’

        <p>Html</p>
        <p>
            HTML: <section> tag takes al the screen width. That means, if I want some element to take all the width of the screen, I can store it inside a section tag.
        </p>
        <h2>Questions:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Where is all of that information saved?</li>
            <li>Why is it that it doesn’t disappear if I leave the page?</li>
            <li>How much information can I store?</li>
            <li>How much time will it be available?</li>
            <li>What about sessions?</li>
        </ul>
